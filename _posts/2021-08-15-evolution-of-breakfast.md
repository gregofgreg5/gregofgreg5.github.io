 # The Evolution of Breakfast
 
August 15, 2021, a lazy Sunday.

I’ve never been a breakfast guy. That being said, I do have a number of favorite breakfasts. In fact, I really love some breakfast foods. I just don’t always like eating in the morning.  This is a story about one of those breakfasts and its remarkable evolution this week.

Almost 30 years ago I worked at a Kinko’s on Blossom Hill Road, in San Jose, CA. Next door was a bagel shop. It wasn’t a big box bagel shop like Noah’s or anything fancy like that. It was a Mom & Pop shop. Their bagels were pretty good, their coffee was fine, but this is about their ham & egg breakfast bagel.

One of the breakfast foods that I like a lot are McDonald’s Sausage & Egg McMuffin. This bagel was kind of like that, but with ham instead of sausage and a bagel instead of  muffin. Otherwise just the same.

Now what has stuck with me for all these years isn’t the breakfast sandwich per se, but how they made the breakfast sandwich. They cracked an egg or two into a Styrofoam cup, stirred it up and microwaved it it for two minutes. Then they popped it out and plopped it on to a bagel with cheese (which it melted) and a piece of ham. 

In 1994, the idea of microwaving a scrambled egg had never occurred to me. It was genius. I’m sure millions of people did it every day, but it was a game changer for me. I spent the next few decades using this technique to make a quick breakfast sandwich. I even had a particular plastic container that I used, that was perfectly bread-shaped, since we rarely stock bagels. 

Somewhere along the way I started mixing in a little milk, like I would an egg that I scrambled in a pan. Over all, I was pretty happy with my legacy food option.

Then last week we were at the grocery store (Raley’s) and they had these Jimmy Dean “Simple Scrambles” on clearance. Ordinarily, I don’t buy the “instant breakfast” stuff for myself, I tend to think that they’re over-priced and I just get something savory instead, like a hot pocket or a frozen burrito, for when I go the instant breakfast route. But the price was right and these looked intriguing, so I bought a handful of them for less than two bucks each.

Inside the cup there was another cup that contained two eggs and a small bag (40 g) of pre-cooked meat and cheese. Making it was simple: shake the egg container, pour it into the cup, microwave it for 50 seconds. Mix in the bag of yummies, microwave it for another ~40 seconds. The end product was pretty excellent, for two eggs and a small bag of pre-cooked meat and cheese.

The next day I tried it again, but this time, I dumped it into a bread-shaped container, toasted a couple pieces of bread and a sandwich was hatched! I thought about going to pick up more of those packs, when I realized that I could just make my own. Instead I picked up some (Jimmy Dean) breakfast sausage and cheese. Browned the sausage and packed up 40g containers for each day. 

A week later, the experiment has gone well. I’ve made sandwiches each day this week and a burrito to mix it up this morning. I’ve frozen the left over sausage (there was a ton) and picked up some chorizo for the next batch.
