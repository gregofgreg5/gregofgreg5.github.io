I have a newly created goal of reading at least three comics from each of my comic subscriptions per month. I, of course, came up with this goal on the last weekend of the month, so I had some catching up to do. I started the project with Mark Russell’s Fantastic Four: Life Story #1 ([review](https://gregofgreg5.github.io/fantastic-four-life-story-1-review/)), which was good, but left me hungry for a legit Fantastic Four story. A good ol’ story about the First Family.

For the third book of the month, I found this one-shot by Christopher Cantwell. Cantwell wrote the Doctor Doom series (2020), which I thought was wonderful and I’ve enjoyed a few of his Iron Man issues as well. He’s absolutely a dude whose work I enjoy.

This book was exactly what I wanted and more. It feels like a classic Fantastic Four comic. The characters roll off the page as if they were freshly out of the Byrne run of the 80’s. Sure, they’ve got more stuff going on. I didn’t really understand all the stuff going on with Val & Franklin, but I understood enough. This book was the helium that lifts the balloon that was missing from Russell’s story. And there was nothing *wrong* with Russell’s take on the FF, they just weren’t (and aren’t meant to be) the familiar family.

Andrade’s art was also exactly what I hoped for. A cross between Adam Polina and Walt Simonson, the pencils fit the feel of the book perfectly, whether it was just a moment in time or breath-taking horror, more on that in a second.  There’s a simplicity to his art, that echoes David Aja or Skottie Young (which kind of gave it that “Polina feel”), and there were harder edges, like the master, Simonson.

What was best about this book was the way Cantwell captured the characters, in their intentions, their personalities and dialogue. But that’s also not a slight on the story, which was top notch. What starts as a very Byrne-like adventure between adventures turns into a scientific mystery and then quickly into a legit horror story. 

It wasn’t one hundred percent perfect, the MacGuffin at the end is well, *meh*, but that really doesn’t detract from the quality of the story.

**Rating: A **
