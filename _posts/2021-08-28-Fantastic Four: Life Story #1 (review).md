I have a Marvel Universe Unlimited subscription and realized this afternoon that I hadn’t read any books this month. It’s been that kind of month. Instead of jumping into one of the series that I had on my library list, I thought I would try a handful of books on the “released this week”. Not exactly at random, since I was still going to pick, but also not necessarily something I would have chosen if I had no restrictions.

The first book I chose was Fantastic Four: Live Story #1. The premise of the “Life Story” series is to re-tell classic Marvel stories, going back from their origin, one decade at a time. So, for example the FF originated in 1961 so this series starts in 1961 and the first issue tells their story through 1969. I really enjoyed the Spider-man series.

When I picked this title, I hadn’t realized that it was written by Mark Russell. Russell is one of the up & coming (heck, maybe by now actually established) super stars in comics. I first heard of him on the iFanboy reviews a few years ago and checked out a couple of his titles. He has a very different voice in today’s comics and I appreciate that, even if sometimes I didn’t really click with the story.

Armed with that info, I started FF: LS #1.

Overall, it the story didn’t disappoint and I’m looking forward to the next one. As a re-imagining Russell takes some interesting creative liberties, most that work, but some that seem to strip the charm from the “First Family”.

This isn’t really a critical review. In fact, I did like the story. What I didn’t think felt right was changing the relationship between Ben & Reed. I can kind of understand the “why”, as it relates to a plot point in the story, but it strips something valuable from that friendship. Something that might have been an even better foundation for that plot “twist”.  In changing that relationship, what you end up with is a scientist and his girlfriend, her brother and this dude the brother knows. It leaves Reed out on an island. Now, I don’t know if it’s because I am so familiar with this story that it colors my experience, but it feels less like a “family”, even at the beginning stages of one, and more like some folk that have this thing happen to one night. Leaving them really, no reason, other than the story to stay together. That being said, the nature of this story, which is told over the course of a decade, there’s no time to fill that in. 

Russell introduces a scientist antagonist to the story, Dr. Jones, who is the foil for Reed. He plays an almost “Aaron Burr” like role to Reed’s Hamilton. As a foil he’s fine, but what he replaces, isn’t fine, it’s legendary, one of – if not Marvel’s best villain. Doom is tied into the early history and, usually like Ben, to young Reed, in such a way that he’s an integral part of the “family”. An ever-present, constant adversary, who grows into a match for each and all of the FF. Dr. Jones is fine and plays well into the story, but…, and I’m sure he’s coming and I’m sure it’s going to be fabulous, but from the outset the absence of Doom, like Ben and Reed’s friendship, leaves a gaping hole and makes the story feel broken. Even though it’s not. 

All that being said, if you’re looking for a fresh turn at the old yarn, this is it. If you can suspend your expectations and take this story at face value, it’s a good read.

**Rating: B **
