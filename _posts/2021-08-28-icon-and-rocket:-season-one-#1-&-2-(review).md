Do you remember the Milestone line? Before it was DC, then when it was DC? It was such a great idea. It’s heartening that it has continued to find new life, if it hasn’t actually gotten any traction. Truth is, I barely remember the old Milestone comics, other than Static and that I thought they were pretty cool. I haven’t followed a few of the re-launches, but was glad to be able to find these on DC Universe Infinite.

I am critical of Snyder’s take on Superman, the _Man of Steel_ in particular. I think that we have seen a handful of ways to retell the Superman origin and come up with something different, inspired, relevant and respectful of the source material. This is one of those ways. I think, for Icon, the most important turn in the re-imagining of the Superman origin is ***relevant***. 

Icon is a *Red Son* slap in the face to the issues of racism and equality in the United States. In that I specifically mean that this series firmly puts roots in the South and confronts the issue of equality and capital resources for minorities in modern times. In the guise of an all-powerful alien. 

There is a lot to like about the two issues. Hundlin does a nice job introducing Raquel and having her pivot to bring Icon out of the shadows. And while so many important issues are taken head on, it feels like a short cut that Icon has been *just hiding* out in the downtrodden community, only to be brought out by this youthful evangelist. I’m assuming that there’s a set-up story that goes along with the antagonist that is introduced in **episode two** that will make Icon’s hesitance or even passive approach all these years make sense. That’s not a huge lift, really. But it's going to need to be well developed and compelling to both explain him hiding (not being active) and also being immensely wealthy.

Obviously, one gets the sense that there are other costumed superheroes out in the world, but it isn't entirely clear where this new _Milestone universe_ fits in with any other DC super continuum or even world.

Overall, I enjoyed these first two issues. Braithwaite’s art is a wonderful compliment to the story, it has the gritty feel of a more grounded story, while keeps pace with the super powered exploits of the main characters and antagonists. My only real complaint is Icon’s costume. I always thought his costume was absolutely inspired. The re-imagining is less so.
