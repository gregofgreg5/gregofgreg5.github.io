It has been three days since we last saw Force Grey. Everyone has had a full rest (or two or three) and had time to look over the amenities of their cabins. Like the staterooms on Thyragarr Station, the cabins on board *The Aurora* are *themed* to the experiences of the inhabitants, in era, realm and plane.

The vessel, like the station, are designed to minimize confusion and prevent passengers from exploring or learning too much about anything outside of their experiences. For Force Grey, the sterile, white, ceramic (metal?) corridors and chambers in the common areas of the ship were the most unusual.

The ship lacked any other inter-thruway connections, like the Hub at the station. On board the ship, there is no sensation of movement. Gnomes or anyone particularly attuned to the ground or a specific plane sometimes have motion-sickness like illness frequently during the travel. These creatures can sometimes feel the sensation of motion, though they cannot usually tell which direction the vessel is moving.
